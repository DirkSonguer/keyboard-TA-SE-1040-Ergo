# Triumph-Adler SE 1040 Ergo Study
This repo documents the Triumph-Adler 1040 Ergo Study keyboard. Personally, I have been a fan of Triumph-Adler keyboards for quite some time, especially the [TA 1040 series of keyboard computers](https://github.com/DirkSonguer/keyboard-TA-SE-1040). In 2023, I came across a weird version that I couldn't identify - the "Ergonomiestudie".

I was able to obtain the keyboard from the estate of Gernot Haltenorth, a previous technical writer for Triumph-Adler. Haltenorth rescued the "Ergonomiestudie" ("Ergo Study") prototype board when the company closed its development and production facilities around 1993, as any unfinished or unsellable inventory was about to be destroyed. In fact, besides many regular Triumph-Adler typewriters and computers, the collection did contain many prototypes based around existing boards.

What makes the ergo study special is that Triumph-Adler never released any ergonomic keyboard layout - neither on a typewriter, not with their Aphatronic computers. So while this study looks pretty complete and usable, it never made it into production.

The other interesting aspect is the time. As far as I can date the keyboard, it was likely created in the mid to late 1980s. This puts it right in the [early wave of ergonomic studies](http://xahlee.info/kbd/i2/split_keyboard__david_Rempel_2008_HF.pdf), around the time of the [TRON keyboard](http://xahlee.info/kbd/TRON_keyboard.html). This was before the APple Adjustable keyboard (1992), the Kinesis Corporation Model 100 (1992) and the Microsoft Natural Keyboard (1994).

It seems like the ergo study was specifically created for just that - scientific and technical studies on typing preference, ergonomics, features, and internal components. I couldn't find any official documentation of mention of the board, expect one: A [technical illustration](https://www.provinz.bz.it/katalog-kulturgueter/de/neu-erfasste-objekte.asp?kks_priref=150016971) in the typewriter museum "[Peter Mitterhofer](https://www.schreibmaschinenmuseum.com/en/)" in Switzerland (shown below with permission). Note that the illustration describes the keyboard as an SE 1041, which is the SE 1040 edition with internal memory expansion & external 5.25 floppy disk drive.

The aim is to document the keyboard as detailed as possible for fans of Triumph-Adler boards, as well as ergo keyboard enthusiasts.
