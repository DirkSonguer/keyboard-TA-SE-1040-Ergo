# Triumph Adler SE 1040 Ergo Study
This repo documents the Triumph Adler 1040 Ergo Study keyboard. I was able to obtain this keyboard from the estate of Gernot Haltenorth, a previous technical writer for Triumph Adler. Haltenorth rescued the "Ergonomiestudie" prototype board when the company closed its development and production facilities around 1993, as any unfinished or unsellable inventory was about to be destroyed.

The aim is to document the keyboard as detailed as possible for fans of Triumph Adler boards, as well as ergo keyboard enthusiasts.

Not much is known about this prototype. There seems to be a [technical illustration](https://www.provinz.bz.it/katalog-kulturgueter/de/neu-erfasste-objekte.asp?kks_priref=150016971) in the typewriter museum "[Peter Mitterhofer](https://www.schreibmaschinenmuseum.com/en/)" in Switzerland. Note that the illustration describes the keyboard as an SE 1041, which is the SE 1040 edition with internal memory expansion & external 5.25 floppy disk drive.

As far as I can date the keyboard, it was likely created in the late 1980s, making it older than the Kinesis Corporation Model 100 (1992) and the Microsoft Natural Keyboard (1994). However, this is not to say that this is the first commercial ergonomic keyboard as it is clearly a prototype, not ready for production.
